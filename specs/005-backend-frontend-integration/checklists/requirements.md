# Specification Quality Checklist: Backend-Frontend Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-10  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined

## Notes

- Tech Stack 섹션은 구현 참고용으로 포함 (스펙 자체는 기술 중립적)
- Phase 분리로 점진적 구현 가능
- Seed 데이터 스크립트는 개발/테스트 용도
